# ReminderApp
The Reminder App is a simple Python script that allows you to set up regular reminders at one-minute intervals. It uses the Plyer library to display notifications on your computer, making it a useful tool to keep you on track with your tasks.

**How It Works**
The Hourly Reminder App operates by running a loop in the background that sleeps for one minute between reminders. When the time elapses, it displays a notification with the title "Reminder" and the message "One minute has passed." This can be customized to suit your needs.

**Getting Started**
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the Plyer library using pip install plyer.
Clone or download this repository to your computer.

**Usage**
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you've placed the script.
Run the script using python hourly_reminder.py.

**Customization**
You can customize the notification title, message, and timeout duration in the hourly_reminder function within the script. Adjust these values according to your preferences.

**Stopping the App**
To stop the Hourly Reminder App, press Ctrl + C in the terminal or command prompt where the script is running. This will terminate the application gracefully.
